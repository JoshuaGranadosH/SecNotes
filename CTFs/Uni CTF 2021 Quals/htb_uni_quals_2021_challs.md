## Oracle Leaks

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 2/4 |
| Info | Steam Technologies is a service provider which uses strictly steam-powered computers. They have recently developed a new type of oracle taking advantage of the steam-power architecture. They offer a huge price in case someone decrypts the message from their service. Are you up for the challenge? |

## Waiting List

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 3/4 |
| Info | Your mechanical arm needs to be replaced. Unfortunately, Steamshake Inc which is the top mechanical arm transplants has a long waiting list. You have found a SQL injection vulnerability and recovered two tables from their database. Could you take advantage of the information in there to speed things up? Don't forget, you have a date on Monday! |

## The Vault

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 2/4 |
| Info | After following a series of tips, you have arrived at your destination; a giant vault door. Water drips and steam hisses from the locking mechanism, as you examine the small display - "PLEASE SUPPLY PASSWORD". Below, a typewriter for you to input. You must study the mechanism hard - you might only have one shot... |

## Pneumatic Validator

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 3/4 |
| Info | In some alternate reality, computers are not electronics-based but instead use air pressure. No electrons are zipping by and instead, a large pneumatic circuit takes care of all the math. In that world, we reverse engineers are not staring countless hours into debuggers and disassemblers but are inspecting the circuits on a valve level, trying to figure out how the particles will behave in weird components and how they are connected. Thinking about it, that doesn't sound too different, does it?  |

# Forensics

## Peel back the layers

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 1/4 |
| Info | An unknown maintainer managed to push an update to one of our public docker images. Our SOC team reported suspicious traffic coming from some of our steam factories ever since. The update got retracted making us unable to investigate further. We are concerned that this might refer to a supply-chain attack. Could you investigate?

## Strike Back

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 2/4 |
| Info | A fleet of steam blimps waits the final signal from their commander in order to attack gogglestown kingdom. A recent cyber attack had us thinking if the enemy managed to discover our plans and prepare a counter-attack. Will the fleet get ambused??? |

## Keep the steam activated

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 3/4 |
| Info | The network in which our main source of steam is connected to, got compromised. If they managed to gain full control of this network, it would be a disaster! |

# Hardware

## Out of time

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 1/4 |
| Info | Quick we need to get access to the bunker and we are running out of time! The door is using an advanced steam-powered door locking mechanism which we cannot breach. One of our scientists managed to make a tool that measures the mechanical stress of the pipes moving steam during the verification of the password and created a power consumption model but it looks like just random signals. Can you find anything useful in the data? |

## Mechanical madness

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 3/4 |
| Info | We have intercepted an encrypted message with critical information, and also managed to recover the machine that is able to decrypt it, with a copy of the source program it should run to decrypt the message. The crazy scientist that built this machine was accidentally killed during the extraction. It's a very elaborate mechanical machine with tons of pipes and valves but we managed to reverse-engineer its logic and build a simulation out of it, but now we need to convert the source of the program into something that the machine is able to understand and execute! The encrypted message is already loaded into the simulation. |

## Tree of danger

| Atributo | Descripción |
|---|---|
| Dificultad | 3/4 |
| Info | As you approach SafetyCorp's headquarters, you come across an enormous cogwork tree, and as you watch, a mechanical snake slithers out of a valve, inspecting you carefully. Can you build a disguise, and slip past it? |

You can't let them take away your loyal doggo Julius. The robots have been trained to classify all the objects they encounter using the SigmaNet network. Can you use your laser pointer to change some of the robot's vision pixels forcing it to misclassify your dog's image as a non-animal object? |
